  <h1>About Roadrunner STEM Initiative</h1>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Founded in 2025 by Tomas Valdez, Roadrunner STEM Initiative emerged from a clear community need. Our surveys across Doña Ana County revealed significant gaps in accessible STEM education and digital literacy resources. We discovered limited year-round options for students, few affordable programs, and a lack of technology education during school breaks.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We exist to close the digital divide in Doña Ana County by delivering accessible, hands-on STEM learning and digital literacy programs to underserved students, families, and communities.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>A Doña Ana County where all residents—regardless of economic status, location, or background—have the digital literacy skills needed to thrive in today's technology-driven world.</p>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>Roadrunner STEM Initiative takes a phased, community-centered approach:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Middle school workshops in coding, robotics, and digital literacy</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Expanded programs for elementary and high school students</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Comprehensive digital literacy for adult learners and families</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We believe in making technology education:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessible</strong> - Low-cost or free programs</li>
        <li><strong>Practical</strong> - Skills that translate to real-world applications</li>
        <li><strong>Inclusive</strong> - Designed for diverse learning needs and backgrounds</li>
        <li><strong>Engaging</strong> - Hands-on learning that inspires curiosity</li>
    </ul>
